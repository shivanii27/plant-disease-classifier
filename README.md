## âœ¨ Features

- **Instant Disease Detection**: Upload an image of a plant leaf and get immediate diagnosis results
- **Comprehensive Diagnosis**: Provides detailed information on detected diseases, including causes, treatments, and prevention
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Clean, intuitive UI with image previews and visualization of results
- **Multiple Plant Support**: Currently supports tomatoes, potatoes, and bell peppers
- **High Accuracy**: 96.5% accuracy on test datasets
- **Example Images**: Try the application with pre-loaded example images

## ðŸ§ª Supported Plant Diseases

The model can currently identify the following plants and diseases:

- **Tomato**:
  - Healthy
  - Bacterial Spot
  - Early Blight
  - Late Blight
  - Leaf Mold
  - Septoria Leaf Spot
  - Spider Mites
  - Target Spot
  - Yellow Leaf Curl Virus
  - Mosaic Virus

- **Potato**:
  - Healthy
